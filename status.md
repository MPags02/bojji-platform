Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've drawn and added to my game the player model (Bojji), grass, dirt, the sun, and a sky. I have also added short animations for him walking left and right, he is also able to jump. There is gravity.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet been able to add platforms that the player can stand on, I have them in the level but they're practically elements of the background. I will also need to add an end goal and attempt to add enemies.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I don't think I am going to be able to make a jumping animation. I tried but am having difficulty doing it while having left and right movement animations
