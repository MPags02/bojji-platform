# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Adventures of Bojji

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A platformer game with a theme centered around the TV show Ranking of Kings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Most of it will be a simple platformer game. Run and jump to other platforms, collect items/coins, and hopefully add enemies. It will work like you'd expect any platformer game to, you die if you fall too far or fail to pass an obstacle, you restart the level in that situation. I would also like to add some sort of cutscene in between certain levels to more immerse the player in the experience.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Good: A game which has death and respawn functions, keeps track of a player's lives lost. All items/coins must be completed to finish a level. Multiple levels. Stale background

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Better: Same as the good outcome, but with cutscenes (really just an image with text) to more entertain the player and a better background. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best: A game with cutscenes and enemies to fight. The levels have increasing difficulty and it takes the user multiple attempts to finish the harder levels. There would also be easter eggs/secrets. Best background elements.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have to become mmore familiar with pygame. I have watched a couple of youtube videos but still have a lot of work to do. I need to create a model for the playable character Bojji. I also need to find or create pictures for the ground/platforms/sky/enemies.
