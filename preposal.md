# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to make a platformer game in python using pygame. I want to base the characters and "story" off of the TV show Ranking of Kings. I would also like to attempt to add enemies that you must fight to the game, but that may be too difficult, not sure yet. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Python is the only coding language I have decent knowledge of. If you have a reccomendation for a better software to code a game on I would love to take a look at it.
